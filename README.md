## Requirements

Elm 0.19

## How to build it

```
elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.html
```

## Tasks

Implement the following two tasks in order, each as a separate commit:

1. When a user submits the form with an empty field the program should choose one of "cat", "dog" or "llama" and fetch one gif for the chosen keyword. The text field should remain empty.

2. When a user submits the form, instead of replacing previous gif with a new one display all of them one after another with the most recent gif at the top.

Once you're done, remove elm-stuff, zip the whole directory and send it to me via email.
